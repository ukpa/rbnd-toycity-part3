How long did you spend working on this project?
1.5 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Project was pretty simple and straight forward, but helped me
sharpen my OOP concepts

What two additional features did you build? Why?
Because of thesis and studies, haven't added any new features but i'll
add one later for purchasing multiple items in a single transaction and
generating a bill in the end. But i did completed all that was required.

Where do you still have room to grow?
Ruby api is huge and i want to go through it as much as i can,
so while programming it comes in handy to use the predefined methods rather
then wasting time creating my own.

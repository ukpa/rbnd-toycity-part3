How long did you spend working on this project?
1.5 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Project was pretty simple and straight forward, but helped me
sharpen my OOP concepts

What two additional features did you build? Why?
You can view the inventory by calling "Product.product_list".
You can also look at the previous transactions with every details and total
revenue of the store by calling "Transaction.in_detail".
I added these features, so that user can view whats there in the inventory
rather then guessing all the time and also the sellers can easily go
through their sales and the revenue.

Where do you still have room to grow?
Ruby api is huge and i want to go through it as much as i can,
so while programming it comes in handy to use the predefined methods rather
then wasting time creating my own.
